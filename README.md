## Experimental Principle
### 1. Logistic regression  
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks. Its goal is to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a given class or not. It is a statistical algorithm that analyzes the relationship between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable. When the dependent variable is binary, it is used to predict the output. For example, it can be used to predict whether an email is spam or not based on certain features of the email. The algorithm describes the relationship between the independent and dependent variables by finding the best fit line. This line is then used to predict new data points.
### 2. Neural Network
#### 2.1 Concept
A neural network is a machine learning algorithm that mimics the human brain. It can learn from data and provide responses in the form of predictions or classifications. They are used for various tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, and medical diagnosis. Neural networks consist of layers of nodes, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node is connected to another node and has associated weights and thresholds.
