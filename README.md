# Porter Delivery Time Estimation
## Experimental Principle
### 1. Logistic Regression  
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks. Its goal is to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a given class or not. It is a statistical algorithm that analyzes the relationship between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable. When the dependent variable is binary, it is used to predict the output. For example, it can be used to predict whether an email is spam or not based on certain features of the email. The algorithm describes the relationship between the independent and dependent variables by finding the best fit line. This line is then used to predict new data points.
### 2. Neural Network
#### 2.1 Concept
A neural network is a machine learning algorithm that mimics the human brain. It can learn from data and provide responses in the form of predictions or classifications. They are used for various tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, and medical diagnosis. Neural networks consist of layers of nodes, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node is connected to another node and has associated weights and thresholds.

Neural networks are just one of many tools and methods in machine learning algorithms. Neural networks themselves are also used as part of many different machine learning algorithms to process high-level input into something a computer can understand.
#### 2.2 BP Neural Network
The BP neural network algorithm is a widely used algorithm that can be used to train feedforward artificial neural networks or other parameterized networks with differentiable nodes. It is an efficient way to apply Leibniz's chain rules to these networks. BP neural network is a classic algorithm model in machine learning. It is a widely used network model with powerful nonlinear mapping capabilities, generalization capabilities and fault tolerance capabilities. At the same time, the BP neural network algorithm has some shortcomings, such as slow convergence and easy to fall into local minimum.

### 3. Naive Bayes Algorithm
The Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on the statistical Bayes theorem that is designed to perform exploratory and predictive modeling of inputs given a category or categories to perform various classification tasks, such as Filter spam, classify documents, predict sentiment, etc.
